It focuses on (1) the main effects of the three Project MATCH treatments, (2) the prognostic value of client attributes employed in the matching hypotheses, and (3) the attribute by treatment interaction effects. Method: Clients recruited from outpatient settings (n=952) or from aftercare settings (n=774) were randomized to one of the following treatments: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Alcohol consumption and psychosocial functioning during treatment were assessed at the end of the 12-week treatment phase. Results: During the treatment phase, small but statistically significant differences were observed among the three treatment groups.",
